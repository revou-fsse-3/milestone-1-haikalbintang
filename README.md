# Stages of Development

1. First, I collect ideas and inspirations.
2. I decided to make a food-and-drink webApp, developing my motherâ€™s brand at the same time.
3. I make a simple wireframe on real paper.
4. I started to make an index.html file, css folder, fonts folder, img folder, and later js folder.

6. First I fill in the head (title, icon, and stylesheet).

# Design Choices

1. **Choose a Logo or a Color Palette or a hero section Picture first.** And I chose the logo below.
   ![](./img/sticker/logombk.png)
   This logo is made by my sister for our mother's brand. Actually, I like the logo, especially because it looks elegant with black and yellow-gold, except for the font-family.

2. After I chose the logo, I made a color palette out of it.

3. Then I prefer this one:
   ![](./img/doc/prefer-1.PNG)
   over this:
   ![](./img/doc/over-1.PNG)
   Because it looks better for me.

4. I let them like this, because it's not bad according to me.
   ![](./img/doc/nav-link.PNG)
   I just added some text-decoration like this:
   ![](./img/doc/nav-link-2.PNG)

5. Then I want the font-family of my hero section to be a handwriting font. So I change this:
   ![](./img/doc/hero-1.PNG)
   To this:
   ![](./img/doc/hero-2.PNG)
6. Last, I decided to make the footer as simple as the Expected Output:
